    <!-- Chosen Palette: Slate & Sky -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A non-linear, interactive dashboard layout. The user is greeted with a high-impact hero section featuring key quantifiable achievements. A central navigation hub of 'competency cards' allows users to dynamically filter the main content area. Clicking a card (e.g., 'Cloud & Infra') updates the 'Experience & Impact' section with domain-specific summaries, quantified achievements, and a relevant visualization. A timeline chart provides an at-a-glance view of the expert's overlapping experience. This structure was chosen to make a complex, multi-domain profile easily digestible for time-constrained recruiters, encouraging exploration and highlighting strategic impact over a simple chronological history. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Hero Stats: Goal: Inform/Impress -> Dynamic number counters (JS) for immediate impact.
        - Competency Cards: Goal: Organize/Navigate -> Clickable cards (JS events) to filter content. Justification: Intuitive, modern navigation pattern for SPAs.
        - Experience Timeline: Goal: Organize/Compare -> Horizontal Bar Chart (Chart.js) to visually represent overlapping years of experience. Justification: Solves the core challenge of communicating the depth and breadth of concurrent expertise.
        - Achievement Metrics: Goal: Compare/Inform -> Dynamic Bar/Doughnut Charts (Chart.js) for each competency. Justification: Visualizes key metrics from the report (e.g., incident reduction), making them more memorable and impactful than text alone.
        - All visualizations are rendered on Canvas via Chart.js, adhering to the no-SVG constraint. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
